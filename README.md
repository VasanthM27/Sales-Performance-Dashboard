# Retail Sales Performance Analysis Project

## Project Overview and use cases
This project involves analyzing retail sales data to generate key insights into product performance, sales segments, and geographical trends. The dataset contains information about product sales, sales channels, and country-wise sales distribution. The goal of this analysis is to identify top-grossing products, evaluate sales by segment and country, and understand customer behavior in response to promotions and advertisements.

## Project Benefits
- Identification of the top-grossing products, helping the business prioritize stock and promotion efforts.
- Understanding of sales performance across different channels (catalog, in-store, online) to optimize marketing strategies.
- Insights into country-wise sales trends to guide global sales strategies.
- Evaluation of customer response to different types of promotions and advertisements, allowing for targeted campaigns.

## Project Steps:
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Imported raw sales data into Looker.
- Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query to ensure accurate and consistent analysis.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analysis
- **Top-Grossing Products**: Identified products generating the highest revenue, focusing on those contributing the most to overall sales.
- **Sales by Segment**: Analyzed sales by various channels (catalog, in-store, online, reseller) and compared prices vs. unit costs.
- **Sales by Country**: Examined the country-wise distribution of sales, with China and the United States as top contributors.
- **Ad Response**: Compared customer responses to catalog and in-store advertisements to evaluate the effectiveness of each.

### Location-Based and Company-Based Analysis
- Created visualizations showing sales performance by country and region using a map representation.
- Evaluated company contributions to total sales, identifying top performers like Fabrikam, Inc. and Adventure Works.

### Insights and Reporting
- Generated interactive visuals in Looker to present findings to stakeholders, providing clear and decision-making insights.

  - Total sales by product and country
  - Percentage of ad recall by promotion type
  - Response rates to advertisements across different sales channels

## Final Looker Dashboard
The dashboard consists of the following sections:
- **Top-Grossing Products**: A bar chart showing the top products by revenue.
- **Sales Segments**: A segmented bar chart comparing unit cost vs. price across various sales channels.
- **Sales by Country**: A bar chart showing sales distribution across countries, with a map visualization for further insights.
- **Company Contributions**: A bar chart highlighting which companies drove the most sales.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into retail sales performance across different segments, countries, and promotion strategies. The analysis helped identify top products, key sales channels, and customer behavior trends, supporting better business decision-making.

## Future Work
Further analysis could be conducted to:
- Analyze seasonal trends in product sales.
